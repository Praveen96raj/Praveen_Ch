	Infrastructure of Swarm:
	Create 3 node one is manager and another two are workers
	Manager node: docker swarm init --advertise-addr 50.17.175.54 (public ip)
	Run the below command to join the worker nodes
	docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-65hfo219b79t18q9n3f9euzoe840k9f30hw7niiji7cwua8d0u-8g4fymwhfkrlbvxm1m2nb9hx8 50.17.175.54:2377
	To check nodes on docker swarm: docker node ls 
	Here * Indicates the current node like master branch on git
	Now we created the docker swarm cluster

docker info				: To see all the docker info running on our machine.
docker swarm leave			: To down the docker node (need to wait few sec)
docker node rm node-id			: To remove the node permanently
docker swarm leave			: To delete the swarm but will get error
docker swarm leave â€“force		: To delete the manager forcefully
docker swarm join-token worker	: To get the token of the worker
docker swarm join-token manager	: To get the token of the worker

Creation:

docker service create --name raham --replicas 3 --publish 80:80 httpd

raham : service name replicas : nodes publish : port reference image: apache

docker service ls 		: To list the services
docker service ps service-name	: To see where the services are running
docker ps			: To see the containers (Check all nodes once)
docker rm -f names		: To remove the service (it will come again later)
public ip on browser		: To check its up and running or not
docker service inspect --pretty remo : To inspect the container
docker service rm service-name	: To remove the service
